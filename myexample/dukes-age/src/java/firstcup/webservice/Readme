DukesAgeResource is a JAX-RS resource class that responds to HTTP GET requests and
returns a String representing the age of Duke at the time of the request.

To create DukesAgeResource, use the wizard provided by the JAX-RS plug-in for NetBeans IDE to generate the resource class. 
This class is annotated with the javax.ws.rs.Path annotation, 
which specifies the URL suffix to which the resource will respond. 
DukesAgeResource has a single method, getText, 
annotated with the javax.ws.rs.GET and javax.ws.rs.Produces annotations. 
@GET marks the method as a responder to HTTP GET requests, 
and @Produces specifies the MIME-type of the response sent back from getText to clients. 
In this case, the MIME-type is text/plain.


Creating the Endpoint
In NetBeans IDE, create a web project with a source file called DukesAgeResource.java in the firstcup.webservice package using the RESTful Web Service wizard.

Create the Project in NetBeans
From the File menu, choose New Project.
In the Categories pane, select Java Web.
In the Projects pane, select Web Application.
Click Next.
In the Project Name field, type dukes-age.
In the Project Location field, browse to tut-install/myexample, where tut-install is the location of the firstcup tutorial installation.
Click Next.
Select your GlassFish Server instance from the Server menu.
Select Java EE 6 Web from the Java EE Version menu.
In the Context Path field, type /DukesAgeService.
Click Finish.
You should now see the module you created in the Projects tab.

From the Projects tab, right-click the index.jsp file and select Delete. Click Yes in the dialog.
Create the DukesAgeResource Class
Select the dukes-age project in the Projects tab.
From the File menu, choose New File.
In the Categories pane, select Web Services.
In the File Types pane, select RESTful Web Services From Patterns.
Click Next.
Under Select Pattern, select Simple Root Resource and click Next.
In the Resource Package field, type firstcup.webservice.
In the Path field, type dukesAge.
In the Class Name field, type DukesAgeResource.
From the MIME Type menu, select text/plain.
Click Finish.
In the REST Resources Configuration dialog, uncheck Add Jersey Library and click OK.

Configure the dukes-age Web Application
Set the default URL that is brought up in a web browser when you run dukes-age.

Right-click the dukes-age project in the Projects tab and select Properties.
In the Categories pane, click Run.
Set Relative URL to /resources/dukesAge.
Click OK.
Remove the putText Method
The DukesAgeResource JAX-RS resource doesn't respond to HTTP PUT requests. Delete the generated putText method in DukesAgeResource.

Building and Deploying the Web Service
Build the JAX-RS web application and deploy it to your GlassFish Server instance.

Build and Deploy the Web Service Endpoint
Compile, package, and deploy dukes-age.war to GlassFish Server. This task gives instructions on deploying dukes-age.war in NetBeans IDE.

Right-click dukes-age in the Projects tab and select Run.
After dukes-age.war deploys successfully to GlassFish Server a web browser will load the URL of the DukesAgeResource path, and you'll see the returned String representing Duke's age.


**** ApplicationConfig path is wrong, need to change to match relative path setting for this project
